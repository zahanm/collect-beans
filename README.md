## `collect-beans`

My app for collecting and sorting through [Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/) transactions. Beancount is an implementation of [Plain Text Accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/).

This uses [Plaid](https://plaid.com) to fetch transactions.

See the respective READMEs in `bookkeeper/` to set up the app.

## Dependencies

- 1Password CLI on the client machine
- Docker on the host that will be running this
